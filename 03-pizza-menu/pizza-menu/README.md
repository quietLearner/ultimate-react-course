npx create-react-app pizza-menu

npm start

imperative vs declarative

imperative: giving an authoritative command

declarative: describe what ui should look like using jsx, based on current data. never touch DOM directly

prop = property
props: passing data from parent to child component

component = data + logic + appearance

component is pure function

data = props + state

props, read only(by child) from parent compoent, only updated by parent component

state: internal data updated by compent's logic
